Developing a Dynamic Pricing Strategy for Used and Refurbished Devices using Supervised Learning​

- The predictive model was established using Linear Regression, featuring key coefficients including the influence of attributes on normalized prices.​

- The R^2 value suggested an 84% explanation of variation in the training data, signifying an effective model.​

- The model's accuracy assures reliable pricing predictions, enhancing Re-Cell's competitiveness in the evolving used device market.​

- Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error on the train and test sets validated the model's robustness.​
